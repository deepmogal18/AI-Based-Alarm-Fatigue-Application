MED SANCHAR – Smart Alarm Management System for Healthcare

National 2nd Runner-Up – GE Healthcare Precision Care Challenge (PCC)
*MED SANCHAR* is an intelligent, mobile-first healthcare monitoring and alarm management system designed to reduce alarm fatigue, improve clinical response time, and enhance patient safety in hospital environments.
This project was developed as part of GE Healthcare’s PCC Challenge, where it secured National 2nd Runner-Up recognition for its innovation, usability, and real-world impact.

Problem Statement:- Modern hospitals generate thousands of alarms daily from patient monitoring devices such as ECGs, infusion pumps, and vital monitors.
However:
A large percentage of these alarms are false or non-critical Nurses and clinicians suffer from alarm fatigue
Critical alarms risk being missed or delayed
Manual triaging increases response time and workload

There is a strong need for an intelligent, centralized alarm management system that prioritizes actionable alerts while filtering noise.

*Solution Overview – MED SANCHAR*

MED SANCHAR is a smart, role-based mobile dashboard that aggregates real-time patient data, intelligently classifies alarms, and supports faster clinical decision-making.

The system simulates a real hospital environment with:

Real-time ECG and infusion device data
AI-assisted alarm validation
Patient-wise monitoring
Role-based dashboards for nurses and administrators

Features:
Smart Alarm Management
Patient-Centric Dashboard
Live Monitoring & Analytics
Secure & Role-Based Access
Smart Interaction & UX


Conclusion: MED SANCHAR demonstrates how thoughtful UI/UX design combined with intelligent alert management can significantly improve healthcare operations. The project showcases a scalable and practical solution to one of the most critical challenges in modern clinical environments — alarm fatigue and delayed response.
